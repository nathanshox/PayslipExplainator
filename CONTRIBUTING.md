You'd like to contribute to the Payslip Explainator? Awesome! Below are some guidelines and notes on requirements and coding style.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repo into your own Github account.
2. Make some changes and push those changes to a feature branch on your fork.
3. Submit a pull request to [nathanshox/PayslipExplainator](https://github.com/nathanshox/PayslipExplainator).

## Notes

1. The only requirement for end users to run the script is that they have Ruby installed. This is specifically so that it is as easy to use as possible. Please don't make any changes that will require the end user to install any Gems. Anything used needs to be in the standard library.

1. In terms of coding style I prefer;
    1. Two spaces, no tabs.
    1. No trailing whitespace.
    1. Blank lines should not have any space.
    1. &&/|| over and/or.
    1. a = b and not a=b.

   But in general, just follow what is already in the source.
